# Analyzing-Chocolate-Bar-Ratings
The Project Overview : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is one of the most crucial steps in a Data Science project. EDA in basic terms is a way of “Understanding the data with the help of visualizations and descriptive statistics”. A lot of courses I signed up for in the past emphasised on the need to use EDA to understand datasets and use this information to either model a ML/DL problem or tell a convincing story about the dataset to a stakeholder. Therefore, through this project I made an attempt at improving my EDA skills using the Chocolate Bar Ratings Dataset.
